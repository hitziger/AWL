MoTIF (Matching of Time-Invariant Filters)

For a description of the algorithm refer to

P. Jost, S. Lesage, P. Vandergheynst, and R. Gribonval, “Learning
redundant dictionaries with translation invariance property: the MoTIF
algorithm,” IEEE, Tech. Rep., 2005.

The included Matlab code of the MoTIF algorithm was kindly provided
to us by the authors, for a comparison with our method E-AWL.
